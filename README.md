# Customized-Commands

The Shell Script "Backup.sh" backs up all the files present in a directory to another specific directory
And adds an extension.bak to the file

The Shell Script "MyRm.sh" runs a customized rm command 
The script accepts multiple files as arguments and instead of deleting them moves them to a WasteBasket folder (Which is created by the script on initial run)
